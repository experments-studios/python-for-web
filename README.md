# Python for Web

This project is a **compiler** that converts certain simple Python code into JavaScript.

The main goal is to make Python code run **faster** and directly in the **browser**.

This compiler supports basic Python commands such as:
* Creating variables (e.g., `x = 10`)
* Writing output to the console (e.g., `print("Hello World")`)
* Simple import statements (`import ...`)

The project enables extremely **fast** execution of Python in a web browser environment.
